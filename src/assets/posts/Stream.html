    I worked as a fulltime software developer for STREAM ticketing
    <a href="http://www.streamticketing.co.nz">www.streamticketing.co.nz</a> over the summer of 2010-2011.
    STREAM Ticketing is a Hamilton based, event ticketing and event access management company.
    I was a part of a small agile team working on a significant upgrade of their e-commerce website and back office system.
    In addition to developing new functionality in their legacy PHP based ticketing website,
    I was responsible for the design and implementation of a complex user flow for seat selection for multi event ticket packages.

    <em>The workflow for purchasing multi event passes and UI is my design. This was built into the
    companies existing site. The colour scheme and branding was pre-existing.</em>

    <em>Note: The site has subsequently been redesigned, and the below functionality may have been replaced.</em>
